    <b> <u><strong>Ulysses </strong></u></b>
    <br/> &nbsp; <br/>
    Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce.
    It was first serialised in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce's 40th birthday. 
    It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called "a demonstration and summation of the entire movement."
    According to Declan Kiberd, "Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking".

    <br/>  <br/>

    Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day, 16 June 1904.
    Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel, with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus, in addition to events and themes of the early 20th-century context of modernism, Dublin, and Ireland's relationship to Britain. 
    The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature.

    <br/>  <br/>

    Since its publication, the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 to protracted textual "Joyce Wars". 
    The novel's stream-of-consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose—replete with puns, parodies, and allusions—as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour, have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history; Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday.
    <br/>  <br/>

    Joyce first encountered the figure of Odysseus/Ulysses in Charles Lamb's Adventures of Ulysses, an adaptation of the Odyssey for children, which seems to have established the Latin name in Joyce's mind. 
    At school he wrote an essay on the character, titled "My Favourite Hero".Joyce told Frank Budgen that he considered Ulysses the only all-round character in literature. He thought about calling his short-story collection Dubliners Ulysses in Dublin, but the idea grew from a story written in 1906, to a "short book" in 1907, to the vast novel he began in 1914.

    <b> <u><strong>The Great Gatsby </strong></u></b>
    <br/> &nbsp; <br/>

    The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. 
    Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional towns of West Egg and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922.
    Many literary critics consider The Great Gatsby to be one of the greatest novels ever written.

    <br/> &nbsp; <br/>

    The story of the book primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession to reunite with his ex-lover, the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. 
    Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval and excess, creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary[a] tale regarding the American Dream. 
    <br/> &nbsp; <br/>

    Fitzgerald, inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island's North Shore, began planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, "something new—something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned."
    Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924.
    His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter. 
    Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book's title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referred to the Roman character Trimalchio; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue.
    published by Scribner's in April 1925, The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly. In its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies.
    Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten.
    However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II,[13] and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades.
    Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title of the "Great American Novel."
</p>

<p id="CornishRexCats_Dc" class = "textfont">

    <b> <u><strong>War and Peace </strong></u></b>
    <br/> &nbsp; <br/>

    The novel chronicles the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families.
    Portions of an earlier version, titled The Year 1805, were serialized in The Russian Messenger from 1865 to 1867, then published in its entirety in 1869.
    <br/> &nbsp; <br/>

    Tolstoy said War and Peace is "not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle." 
    Large sections, especially the later chapters, are philosophical discussion rather than narrative.
    Tolstoy also said that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call War and Peace a novel. 
    Instead, he regarded Anna Karenina as his first true novel.
    <br/> &nbsp; <br/>

   olstoy began writing War and Peace in 1863, the year that he finally married and settled down at his country estate.
   The first half of the book was written under the name "1805". 
   During the writing of the second half, he read widely and acknowledged Schopenhauer as one of his main inspirations. 
   Tolstoy wrote in a letter to Afanasy Fet that what he has written in War and Peace is also said by Schopenhauer in The World as Will and Representation. However, Tolstoy approaches "it from the other side."

    <b> <u><strong>Don Quixote </strong></u></b>
    <br/> &nbsp; <br/>

    The plot revolves around the adventures of a noble (hidalgo) from La Mancha named Alonso Quixano, who reads so many chivalric romances that he loses his mind and decides to become a knight-errant (caballero andante) to revive chivalry and serve his nation, under the name Don Quixote de la Mancha. 
	He recruits a simple farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthy wit in dealing with Don Quixote's rhetorical monologues on knighthood, already considered old-fashioned at the time. Don Quixote, in the first part of the book, does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story.
    <br/> &nbsp; <br/>

    The book had a major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers (1844), Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), and Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac (1897), as well as the word quixotic and the epithet Lothario; the latter refers to a character in "El curioso impertinente" ("The Impertinently Curious Man"), an intercalated story that appears in Part One, chapters 33–35. 
	The 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer cited Don Quixote as one of the four greatest novels ever written.
    <br/> &nbsp; <br/>

    When first published, Don Quixote was usually interpreted as a comic novel. 
	After the French Revolution, it was better known for its central ethic that individuals can be right while society is quite wrong and seen as disenchanting. In the 19th century, it was seen as a social commentary, but no one could easily tell "whose side Cervantes was on". 
	Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixote's idealism and nobility are viewed by the post-chivalric world as insane, and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality. By the 20th century, the novel had come to occupy a canonical space as one of the foundations of modern literature.

    <b> <u><strong>Pride and Prejudice </strong></u></b>
    <br/> &nbsp; <br/>
    Pride and Prejudice is a romantic novel of manners written by Jane Austen in 1813. 
    he novel follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness. 
    Its humour lies in its honest depiction of manners, education, marriage, and money during the Regency era in Great Britain.

    <br/> &nbsp; <br/>

   Mr Bennet of Longbourn estate has five daughters, but his property is entailed and can only be passed to a male heir. 
   His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family will be destitute upon his death. 
   Thus it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well to support the others, which is a motivation that drives the plot. The novel revolves around the importance of marrying for love, not for money or social prestige, despite the communal pressure to make a wealthy match.
    <br/> &nbsp; <br/>

    Pride and Prejudice has consistently appeared near the top of lists of "most-loved books" among literary scholars and the reading public. 
    It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with over 20 million copies sold, and has inspired many derivatives in modern literature.
    For more than a century, dramatic adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions of Pride and Prejudice have portrayed the memorable characters and themes of the novel, reaching mass audiences.
    The 2005 film Pride & Prejudice is the most recent film adaptation that closely represents the book.
